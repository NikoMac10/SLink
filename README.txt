This Repository contains HPC(High performance computing) project, made by Nicolas Pietro Martignon(870034) and Thomas Visentin(869438).
This project was made using MinGW compiler on Windows, there may be some differences
in compiling/running source files/executable on different SO with different compilers. 

This zipped folder contains:
- PDF file with the lesson on Hierarchical Clustering (SLINK), and the specification of the project
- PDF file with the project report.
- SLINK_Sequential.cpp: the actual clustering algorithm implemented in C++ in sequential version
- SLINK_Parallel.cpp: the actual clustering algorithm implemented in C++ in parallel version (4 core)
- *.bat files to compile and execute the code more comfortably under windows.
- *.csv the datasets on which the program was executed.
- *.py for the verification of the proposed algoritm, and for drawing the dendogram.


Please note that in *.py there are some string that contains absolut path file.
