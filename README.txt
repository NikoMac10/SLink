This Repository contains HPC project, this was made using MinGW compiler on Windows, there may be some differences
in compiling/running source files/executable on different SO with different compilers. 

This zipped folder contains:
- 
- SLINK_Sequential.cpp: the actual clustering algorithm implemented in C++ in sequential version
- SLINK_Parallel.cpp: the actual clustering algorithm implemented in C++ in parallel version (4 core)
- *.bat files to compile and execute the code more comfortably under windows.
- *.csv the datasets on which the program was executed.
- *.py for the verification of the proposed algoritm, and for drawing the dendogram.


Please note that in *.py there are some string that contains absolut path file.
